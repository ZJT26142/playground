# Generics
* To create an instance of generic class
`BaseType <Type> obj = new BaseType <Type>()`
  * Note: In the parameter \<Type\>, one cannot use primitive types.
* Generic functions can be called with different types of arguments based on the type of arguments 
    passed to generic method, the compiler handles each method.
## Advantages
1. Code Reuse: 
    One can write a method/class/interface once and use for any type he wants.
2. Type Safety: 
    Makes errors to appear at compile time than at run time.
3. Individual type casting is not needed.
4. implementing generic algorithms
