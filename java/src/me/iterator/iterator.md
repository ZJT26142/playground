# Iterator Design Pattern
* In OOP, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the
    container's elements.
    * This pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific 
        and thus cannot be decoupled.
# Builder Design Pattern 
* To separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
    * Advantages:
       * Allows one to vary a product's internal representation.
       * Encapsulates code for construction and representation.
       * Provides control over steps of construction process.
## Time Stamps
* @09:53 Stack, @10:09 traversal, @10:11 syntactical sugar
